# 🎮 Simon Game

The **Simon Game** is a fun and challenging memory game that tests how well you can remember sequences of colors. The game shows a color sequence — you repeat it:
- "Red → Blue" → Click Red, then Blue
- Next: "Red → Blue → Green" → Click in that order  
It gets harder each round… one wrong move, and it's **game over!**

This project helped me improve my understanding of:
- DOM manipulation
- JavaScript events
- Game logic and interactivity
